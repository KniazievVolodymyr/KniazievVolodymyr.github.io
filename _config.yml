  Hi, my name’s Volodymyr and I’m a senior Java developer, have 5+ years of commercial experience.   
  During that time I participated in different projects: fin-tech, gaming, resource managment, and e-commerce. 
  I was involved in long-term projects which gave me strong experience in various areas of software design and development.   
  My primary interests are connected with Java, programming, reading professional books, discovering new technologies, and implementing it in my day-to-day work.
  Nevertheless I'm always open to new challenges and accept them with interest and enthusiasm.   
  I'm skilled in problem-solving. 
  Besides that, I'm an open-minded and goal-oriented person and have an active teamwork attitude and quick learning ability.

#I am most skilled in: <mark>AWS</mark> and <mark>Eating Pizza</mark>
